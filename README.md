# Water Quality Estimation Device

## Description
This project involves the design, development, and deployment of a fusion sensor system capable of assessing key water quality parameters. The project was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Tushar Sandhan at IIT Kanpur from May 2024 to July 2024.

## Objective
- Designed, developed, and deployed a fusion sensor system capable of assessing key water quality parameters.

## Approach
- Calibrated sensors to measure pH, temperature, turbidity, air particles, and TDS to ensure reliable readings.
- Integrated sensor readings into a display system for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Result
- Improved water quality assessment methods, contributing to better public health and safety.

## Mentor
- Prof. Tushar Sandhan, IIT Kanpur
